# vdj-launchcontrolXL
Virtual DJ - Controller template for Novation Launch Control XL

Todo:

Import similar template for adjustment.
Work with MIDIOX and VDJ developer docs to generate template

Use case for this template:
------------------------------------------------------
Initially, this should be setup as a channel mixer.
Secondarily, an effects mixer.
Ancillary, add mode switching to the unit.

This will be an attempt to use the XL 'analog' style controls for channel mixing for volume, and effects.
Since I have a 2 channel mixer, it puts a few limitations on using the extra 2 virtual decks.
I would like to use my launchpad as sampler, and my dj controller for mixing.

The sampler I have does not have 'analog' style control.
The DJ controller I have loses a couple of valuable features when I use all 5 stems.
The additional launchpad I have has a mix of 'analog' style, and digital controls, but incessantly spams midi heartbeats that case issues.


This will be tested with the following components:
------------------------------------------------------
- Virtual DJ 8
- Focusrite 4i4
- Pioneer DDJ-SB3
- Novation Launch Control XL
- Launchpad X
